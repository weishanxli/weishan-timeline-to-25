              Before his quarter-life crisis in December of 2023, Weishan got into a travel-high state, visiting Japan, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, and Maine. He even picked up a new hobby of snow boarding. But these were all distractions as the dreaded 4th day of December waited at the end of the year.
